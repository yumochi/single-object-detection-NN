# Single Object Detection NN

This is a simple project started by Dihan Yang and Yumo Chi to play around and learn about the basic object localization in images. We intend for this project to be stepping stone toward more complex structures. We will be working actively to expand this project.

The project is based pyTorch, coupled with concepts inspired by YOLOv3. Our current work is based on a simple custom CNN and basic inference using bounding boxes. The original work was inspired by ayooshkathuria's work from his PaperSpace blog on https://blog.paperspace.com/how-to-implement-a-yolo-object-detector-in-pytorch/
